Hummingbird
===========

This project is a fork of https://github.com/troubling/hummingbird.

Hummingbird is a scalable, performant distributed object storage system written in Go
that is also a drop in replacement for [OpenStack Swift](http://swift.openstack.org) with minimal migration.
The goal is to keep the same protocols and on-disk layout while dramatically
improving performance.

Performance
-----------

The following tests were run on 5 nodes with 128GB of RAM, 10 960GB SSD, and 45 10T drives each and 10Gb networking.  The systems were configured to use an EC scheme of 4 data and 2 parity shards.  Each run was for 1,000,000 objects at 250 concurency through a single `nectar` client.
